You cannot tell if the initial haze covering them is a side-effect of the absorption process, or if it's from being dazed and waking from unconsciousness in these memories...#{normal}#

#FIREBRICK#Pain#LAST#.  Everywhere, but where is worst...

Abdomen.  Broken ribs?  Breathe in--  #FIREBRICK#yes they're broken#LAST#.  Shallow breaths.  What happ--  right.  Damned orcs.  Didn't expect them on this continent, much less in a Sher'Tul ruin.  Didn't even expect a Sher'Tul ruin...  Carrying Ziguranth weapons, preventing healing magic from working.  So now we've got #{italic}#two#{normal}# bands of past-their-prime savages working together to burn down civilization.  Lovely.

[...]

Elandar, leaning over me, can't hug me because of my ribcage.  Says I should be dead.  That he found what he thinks is the fabled Blood of Life, and poured it down my throat and into my wounds.  That I'm healing, but...  if he was wrong, we can't go back to them.  Back to #{italic}#her#{normal}# - not after last time.  I can't let them take me from Elandar, not after all he's done for me, no matter what they might find if they analyze what's left in that bottle.

The pain is fading - little by little, ribs mending minute by minute, I can breathe slightly deeper before #FIREBRICK#hitting#LAST# that sudden wall of #FIREBRICK#agony#LAST#.  It feels...  healthy.  Powerful, even.  Whatever my love may have found, his gift is definitely capable of nourishing living creatures...  but there are other feelings too.  Feelings of being trapped.  Lost.  Alone.  Homesick for a home I'm already lying in.

[...]

I have my theories, unsettling as they are, as to what's coming over me - what I suspect to have invisibly replaced my subconscious already, what I constantly feel my conscious thoughts drifting towards if I'm not focusing, why that ability to hold conscious attention on anything else seems to be slipping more every minute.  Committing suicide or sending myself to an Angolwen asylum (if they were that merciful) are not options - egotistical as this sounds, I know the happiness I bring to Elandar's tragic life is the only thing that keeps him going.  I believe I can use this bond and the #FIREBRICK#painfully unnatural#LAST# urges that come with it...  productively, without breaking my love's heart or leaving a worse world behind.  I will be happy, Elandar will be happy, and #FIREBRICK#he#LAST# will be happy.]],

Her demeanor has...  changed, but not in the way one would expect.  If I had given her the essence of some god the Sher'Tul wounded and exsanguinated for a trophy, or a blight-ridden demon, or something else that would affect her mental state, I would expect her to start acting oddly - with more cruelty, more arrogance, less #{italic}#humanity.#{normal}#  Instead...  she acts like she knows the world is about to end and can't tell anyone.  She mutters about needing to use the contents of that ruin, one that we still can't even tell Angolwen #{italic}#exists#{normal}#, to bring about a new order of magocracy like the one Tannen wants "before it's too late."  Something is gnawing at her, and she dreads that I may find out what, but otherwise...  she's almost #{italic}#too#{normal}# rational.

She is terrified of losing me, losing this world, losing #{italic}#herself#{normal}# - but to what, I have no idea.  Ultimately, it does not matter what is running through her mind; I will study the texts in this ruin for summoning rituals, farportal schematics, or something else that would fulfill her plan for her.  She will get to see this "Gerlyk" once, for herself - and then his magic will be absorbed and it will be over.  Whatever this creature is, it can't give orders when it's dead.]],

he suffers on a distant world, his power leeched out bit by bit for reasons never told to him by evildoers he's never seen.  this is not right.  he must be free.  i must be free.  he must come to eyal so our vision for it can finally be realized

...I can't bring myself to stop her.

Argoniel, my love, you have brought me so much joy and given me much to live for.  I have sworn to hold your hand and walk beside you, no matter where you choose to go.  If that means joining you down the road to a second Spellblaze...  so be it.  

Forgive me, Eyal.]],
