You've saved us from the storms!  We can't ever repay you enough, but, well...  Shortly after you stopped them, a witch approached us and offered us some...  magical #{italic}#things#{normal}# and said they would protect our town if anything like that happened again.
It's not that I don't trust her, not after you and they - mostly you! - saved us, but...  I just don't feel comfortable having all this arcane stuff around us all the time.  None of us do.  If you've got a use for these, you're more than welcome to them.

Apparently, they're designed to be mounted on walls and rooftops, and will try to non-lethally incapacitate outside invaders while sending a message of distress to Angolwen.  With a few tweaks, you can make them deadly instead (and avoid harassing Angolwen while you're at it).#{normal}#]],
