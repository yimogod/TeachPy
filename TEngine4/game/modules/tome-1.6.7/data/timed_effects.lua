--	All timed effects are divided into physical, mental, magical, or other types.  Timed effect types are organized based on what saving throw or dispel would be most appropriate
--	along with consideration based on how it can be applied.  There's a lot of overlap between natural and magical timed effects so when in doubt an effect will not be magical.
--	Frozen is a good example of this because of Frost Breath.  Effects falling into the other category have no save and generally can not be removed unless they're specifically called.

--	All subtype organization is based off the root cause if one is available or effect if not.  For example burning is a fire effect, caused by fire.
--	Stun is a more general effect and can have many causes, thus it's subtype is based off its effect, so in this case the subtype is simply 'stun'.
--	Burning Shock could easily fall into either of these subtypes.  First we ask if it has a cause, it does, fire.  Therefore it is subtype 'fire' rather then subtype 'stun'.
