return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You are an Ogre, hailing from Elvala.

You face contempt and fear from a world your kind have never wronged, and the Spellhunt would have eradicated your race entirely, had the Shalore not shown sympathy and granted your ancestors refuge in Elvala.
Nowadays, your people are beginning to shake their old image, but that's not why you've set out for adventure; you've learned of countless problems facing your world, and you intend to fix them yourself.
Your kind were made for combat and hard work, and Maj'Eyal needs a lot of both.  

You have come to the north of the Shaloren capital city of Elvala, in search of the Scintillating Caves. It is infested with vermin and seemingly alive crystals.
To the west lies another dangerous place: a camp of Rhaloren. They are renegade Shaloren who do not wish to restrict their magic usage. Stopping them would be good for the world in general, but especially for your Shaloren benefactors.

After days of travel, you have found the caves and entered it. What will you find there...?
