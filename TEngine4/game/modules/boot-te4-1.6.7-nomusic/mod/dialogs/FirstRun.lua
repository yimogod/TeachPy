- Characters vault: You will not be able to upload any character to the online vault to show your glory
- Item's Vault: You will not be able to access the online item's vault, this includes both storing and retrieving items.
- Ingame chat: The ingame chat requires to connect to the server to talk to other players, this will not be possible.
- Purchaser / Donator benefits: The base game being free, the only way to give donators their bonuses fairly is to check their online profile. This will thus be disabled.
- Easy addons downloading & installation: You will not be able to see ingame the list of available addons, nor to one-click install them. You may still do so manually.
- Version checks: Addons will not be checked for new versions.
- Discord: If you are a Discord user, Rich Presence integration will also be disabled by this setting.
- Ingame game news: The main menu will stop showing you info about new updates to the game.
